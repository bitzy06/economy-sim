# Deeper Financial Systems

This document outlines ideas for enhancing the financial systems within the game, drawing from the "Financial System Enhancements" section of `economy_feature_ideas.md`.

## 1. National Debt and Bonds

*   **Concept:** Allow countries to accrue national debt by issuing various types of bonds (e.g., short-term treasury bills, long-term government bonds).
*   **Bond Mechanics:**
    *   Each bond will have a defined principal amount, an interest rate (coupon rate), and a maturity date.
    *   Bonds can be purchased by:
        *   Other nations (creating diplomatic ties or tensions).
        *   Internal corporations (affecting their capital and potentially loyalty).
        *   Specific "capitalist" population groups (influencing their wealth and political stance).
        *   A national central bank (if such an entity is implemented).
*   **Economic Impact:**
    *   Interest payments on outstanding bonds become a recurring national expense.
    *   Failure to meet interest payments can lead to sovereign default.
*   **Consequences of Sovereign Default:**
    *   Severe damage to the nation's credit rating, making future borrowing extremely costly or impossible.
    *   Significant diplomatic penalties and loss of international prestige.
    *   Potential for creditor nations to gain a *casus belli*.
    *   Internal unrest and a sharp decline in population loyalty.
*   **Debt Management:**
    *   Provide options to pay off debt (either early or upon maturity).
    *   Allow for debt restructuring (negotiating new terms, possibly with associated penalties).
*   **Key Indicator:** The debt-to-GDP ratio will be a critical economic indicator to monitor.

## 2. Central Bank and Monetary Policy

*   **Concept:** Introduce a central bank for each nation, which can be state-controlled or operate with a degree of independence.
*   **Functions of the Central Bank:**
    *   **Interest Rate Control:** Set a base interest rate (discount rate). This will influence commercial bank lending rates, thereby affecting national investment, inflation levels, and savings behavior.
        *   Lowering rates can stimulate borrowing and investment but may increase inflation.
        *   Raising rates can help curb inflation but might slow down economic growth.
    *   **Currency Management:** Control the money supply through minting or printing currency.
        *   Excessive printing will lead to inflation and devalue the currency. This can be a risky short-term fix for government deficits.
    *   **Reserve Requirements:** (If commercial banks are modeled) Set reserve requirements for these banks.
    *   **Lender of Last Resort:** Act as a lender to solvent but illiquid banks during financial panics to prevent systemic collapse.
*   **Management of National Reserves:**
    *   The central bank will manage national gold reserves (or other precious metals like silver).
    *   This impacts currency stability, especially if a Gold Standard is adopted.
    *   **Gold Standard:** Currency is directly convertible to gold at a fixed rate. This limits monetary policy flexibility but offers stability.
    *   **Fiat Currency:** Currency value is based on government decree and public confidence in the economy.
*   **Player Interaction:**
    *   Players may have options to appoint the central bank governor (if it's an independent entity).
    *   Set policy targets, such as an inflation target for the central bank to achieve.

## 3. Stock Market and Investments

*   **Concept:** Model a national or regional stock exchange where shares of corporations can be traded.
*   **Corporate Structure:**
    *   Corporations can be privately owned (by founders, capitalist POPs) or publicly traded (by issuing shares on the stock market).
*   **Market Participants:**
    *   Population groups (especially capitalists, and potentially middle-class POPs).
    *   Other countries or their state-owned corporations.
    *   Other domestic or international corporations.
*   **Share Price Fluctuation:** Share prices will be dynamic, influenced by:
    *   The profitability and growth prospects of the underlying corporation.
    *   Overall economic conditions (e.g., boom or bust cycles).
    *   Significant global events or technological breakthroughs.
    *   Market sentiment and speculative trading.
*   **State Intervention/Interaction:**
    *   The player (as the state) could invest state funds in corporations, though this carries risks of corruption or undue political influence.
    *   Implement regulations for the stock market (e.g., rules for transparency, prevention of insider trading).
    *   Encourage Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) to foster industrial growth and capital formation.
*   **Shareholder Benefits:** Profitable corporations will pay dividends to their shareholders.
*   **Market Risks:** The system should allow for the possibility of stock market crashes and broader financial panics.

## 4. Taxation System Overhaul

*   **Concept:** Implement a more detailed and varied taxation system.
*   **Types of Taxes:**
    *   **Income Tax:**
        *   Can be progressive (higher earners pay a larger percentage of their income).
        *   Can be a flat tax (all earners pay the same percentage).
        *   Directly impacts POP wealth, happiness, and their disposable income for consumption or investment.
    *   **Corporate Tax:** A tax levied on the profits of companies.
        *   Impacts corporate investment decisions and retained earnings.
    *   **Tariffs:** Taxes on imported or exported goods (integrates with International Trade systems).
    *   **Land Tax:** A tax based on land ownership or its assessed value.
        *   Can significantly affect agricultural output and the wealth of aristocratic POPs.
    *   **Consumption Tax (e.g., Sales Tax, VAT):** A tax on goods and services at the point of purchase.
        *   Can be regressive, disproportionately affecting lower-income POPs.
    *   **Poll Tax:** A flat tax levied on every individual.
*   **Tax Rate Flexibility:**
    *   Allow players to set different tax rates for different population strata (e.g., lower, middle, upper classes).
    *   Ability to apply different tax rates to specific economic sectors (e.g., offering tax breaks to encourage new industries).
*   **Impact of Tax Policies:**
    *   Tax rates will affect POP happiness and political radicalism (excessively high taxes can lead to unrest).
    *   Influence industrial growth (high corporate taxes might deter investment).
    *   Directly determine government revenue and the national budget.
*   **Tax Efficiency:**
    *   This will be determined by factors such as the level of bureaucracy, relevant technologies, and the extent of corruption.
    *   Low tax efficiency means a portion of potential tax revenue is lost before it reaches the treasury.

## 5. Subsidies and Tariffs (Financial Aspect)

*   **Subsidies:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Direct payments from the state to specific industries, individual factories, or even directly to consumers (e.g., food subsidies).
    *   **Aims:**
        *   Encourage growth in strategically important sectors.
        *   Protect infant industries from foreign competition.
        *   Maintain employment levels.
        *   Ensure the availability and affordability of essential goods for the population.
    *   **Costs and Risks:**
        *   Subsidies are a direct drain on the national budget.
        *   If maintained for too long, they can lead to inefficient industries that are reliant on government support.
*   **Tariffs (as a financial tool):**
    *   **Primary Goal:** Generate revenue for the state.
    *   **Secondary Goal:** Protect domestic industries by making imported goods more expensive, thus encouraging local production and consumption.
    *   **Risks:**
        *   Can lead to retaliatory tariffs from other nations, harming export industries.
        *   Impacts domestic prices of goods, potentially increasing costs for consumers and other industries.
