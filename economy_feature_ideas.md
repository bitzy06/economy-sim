# Economy Feature Ideas

## I. Financial System Enhancements

1.  **National Debt and Bonds:**
    *   Allow countries to take on debt by issuing bonds (e.g., short-term treasury bills, long-term government bonds).
    *   Define bond terms: principal, interest rate (coupon rate), maturity date.
    *   Bonds can be bought by:
        *   Other countries (diplomatic implications).
        *   Internal corporations (can be a drain or source of capital for them).
        *   Internal "capitalist" pop groups (influences their wealth and loyalty).
        *   A national central bank (if implemented).
    *   Interest payments on debt are a recurring national expense.
        *   Failure to pay can lead to sovereign default.
    *   Consequences of default:
        *   Severe hit to national credit rating, making future borrowing very expensive or impossible.
        *   Diplomatic penalties, loss of prestige.
        *   Potential casus belli for creditor nations.
        *   Internal unrest, reduced pop loyalty.
    *   Ability to pay off debt (early or at maturity) or restructure it (negotiate new terms, potentially with penalties).
    *   Debt-to-GDP ratio as a key economic indicator.
2.  **Central Bank and Monetary Policy:**
    *   Introduce a central bank entity for each nation (can be state-controlled or semi-independent).
    *   Functions of the Central Bank:
        *   **Interest Rate Control:** Set a base interest rate (discount rate) to influence commercial bank lending rates, affecting investment, inflation, and savings.
            *   Lower rates: stimulate borrowing and investment, potentially increase inflation.
            *   Higher rates: curb inflation, potentially slow economic growth.
        *   **Currency Minting/Printing:** Control the money supply.
            *   Excessive printing leads to inflation, devaluing the currency.
            *   Can be a short-term solution for government deficits but with long-term risks.
        *   **Reserve Requirements:** Set reserve requirements for commercial banks (if they are modeled).
        *   **Lender of Last Resort:** Provide liquidity to solvent but illiquid banks during financial panics.
    *   Manage national gold reserves (or other specie like silver).
        *   Impact on currency stability, especially under a Gold Standard.
        *   Gold Standard: Currency directly convertible to gold at a fixed rate. Limits monetary policy flexibility but provides stability.
        *   Fiat Currency: Value based on government decree and market confidence.
    *   Player decisions: Appoint central bank governor (if independent), set policy targets (e.g., inflation target).
3.  **Stock Market and Investments:**
    *   Model a national or regional stock exchange.
    *   Corporations can be:
        *   Privately owned (by founders, capitalists).
        *   Publicly traded (issuing shares on the stock market).
    *   Pops (especially capitalists, possibly middle class) and other countries/corporations can buy and sell shares.
    *   Share prices fluctuate based on:
        *   Corporation profitability and growth prospects.
        *   Overall economic conditions (boom/bust cycles).
        *   Global events, technological breakthroughs.
        *   Market sentiment and speculation.
    *   Player (as the state) could:
        *   Invest state funds in corporations (risky, potential for corruption or political influence).
        *   Regulate the stock market (e.g., transparency rules, insider trading prevention).
        *   Encourage IPOs (Initial Public Offerings) to promote industrial growth.
    *   Dividends paid by profitable corporations to shareholders.
    *   Potential for stock market crashes and financial panics.
4.  **Taxation System Overhaul:**
    *   Implement a variety of tax types:
        *   **Income Tax:**
            *   Progressive: Higher earners pay a larger percentage.
            *   Flat: All earners pay the same percentage.
            *   Impacts pop wealth, happiness, and available income for consumption/investment.
        *   **Corporate Tax:** Tax on company profits.
            *   Impacts corporate investment and retained earnings.
        *   **Tariffs:** Taxes on imported or exported goods (see International Trade).
        *   **Land Tax:** Based on land ownership/value.
            *   Can affect agricultural output and aristocratic wealth.
        *   **Consumption Tax (e.g., Sales Tax, VAT):** Tax on goods and services purchased.
            *   Can be regressive, disproportionately affecting lower-income pops.
        *   **Poll Tax:** Flat tax per person.
    *   Ability to set different tax rates for:
        *   Different pop strata (e.g., lower, middle, upper class).
        *   Specific economic sectors (e.g., tax breaks for new industries).
    *   Impact of tax rates on:
        *   Pop happiness and political radicalism (high taxes can lead to unrest).
        *   Industrial growth (high corporate taxes might deter investment).
        *   Government revenue and budget.
    *   Tax efficiency:
        *   Determined by bureaucracy level, technology, and corruption.
        *   Low efficiency means a portion of potential tax revenue is lost.
5.  **Subsidies and Tariffs (Financial Aspect):**
    *   **Subsidies:**
        *   Direct payments from the state to specific industries, factories, or even consumers (e.g., food subsidies).
        *   Aims: Encourage growth in key sectors, protect infant industries, maintain employment, ensure availability of essential goods.
        *   Costs: A direct drain on the national budget. Can lead to inefficient industries if prolonged.
    *   **Tariffs (as a financial tool):**
        *   Primary goal: Generate revenue for the state.
        *   Secondary goal: Protect domestic industries by making imports more expensive.
        *   Can lead to retaliatory tariffs from other nations.
        *   Impacts domestic prices of goods.

## II. International Trade & Diplomacy

1.  **Trade Agreements & Treaties:**
    *   Types of agreements:
        *   **Bilateral Trade Agreement:** Between two nations.
            *   Reduce tariffs on specific goods or all goods.
            *   Set quotas for certain imports/exports.
            *   Guarantee market access.
        *   **Multilateral Trade Agreement:** Among several nations.
        *   **Customs Union:** Member states eliminate tariffs among themselves and adopt a common external tariff on goods from non-member states. (e.g., German Zollverein).
        *   **Common Market:** A customs union with further harmonization of regulations and free movement of capital and labor.
    *   Economic alliances can complement or be separate from military/diplomatic alliances.
    *   Negotiation process:
        *   Requires diplomatic influence, good relations.
        *   Can be influenced by relative economic power.
        *   May involve concessions on other diplomatic fronts.
    *   Breaking trade treaties can have diplomatic and economic repercussions.
2.  **Trade Routes & Infrastructure:**
    *   Represent physical trade routes:
        *   **Land routes:** Roads, railways. Capacity and cost influenced by terrain and infrastructure level.
        *   **Sea routes:** Shipping lanes. Capacity influenced by port size and naval technology.
        *   **River routes:** Canals and navigable rivers.
    *   Costs associated with trade:
        *   Transportation costs (per unit, per distance).
        *   Tariffs (if applicable).
        *   Risk (piracy, banditry, wartime interdiction).
    *   Infrastructure impact:
        *   `Ports`: Higher levels increase shipping capacity and reduce loading/unloading times/costs.
        *   `Railways`: Significantly increase land trade volume and speed, reduce costs. Connects inland production centers to markets/ports.
        *   `Canals`: Connect waterways, bypassing difficult land routes.
    *   Vulnerability:
        *   Blockades by enemy navies can cripple sea trade.
        *   Raiding (e.g., by cavalry, privateers) can disrupt land or sea routes.
        *   Control of key chokepoints (e.g., Suez Canal, Panama Canal if built) grants significant trade power.
3.  **Global Market & Price Fluctuations:**
    *   A dynamic global market pool for various goods, existing beyond individual city/national markets.
    *   Prices in the global market influenced by:
        *   Total global supply of a good.
        *   Total global demand for a good.
        *   Major economic events: discovery of new resource deposits (e.g., gold rush in California, oil in Persia), crop failures due to blight, widespread wars disrupting production.
        *   Technological changes affecting production costs or creating new demands.
    *   Nations (or their corporations/pops) can buy from or sell to this global market.
        *   Access might be limited by diplomatic status, trade agreements, or control of trade routes.
        *   Transactions incur transport costs and potentially tariffs.
    *   This system allows for more realistic price setting than purely local markets, reflecting global economic trends.
    *   Arbitrage opportunities: Buying low in one market and selling high in another (factoring in costs).
4.  **Foreign Investment & Colonial Exploitation:**
    *   Countries or powerful corporations can invest in:
        *   Building factories, mines, plantations in other countries (especially less developed ones or colonies).
        *   Developing infrastructure (railways, ports) in foreign lands to facilitate resource extraction or market access.
    *   Profits from these investments are often repatriated to the investor nation, boosting its economy.
    *   Forms of investment:
        *   Direct ownership.
        *   Loans to foreign governments or companies for specific projects.
    *   Colonial Exploitation:
        *   Colonies often serve as sources of cheap raw materials and captive markets for manufactured goods from the colonial power.
        *   Different levels of exploitation:
            *   Direct resource extraction with minimal local benefit.
            *   Investment in some local infrastructure to support extraction.
            *   Imposition of cash crops or monoculture.
        *   Can lead to local unrest, rebellion, and calls for independence in colonies.
        *   "Sphere of Influence": A less direct form of economic dominance over a nominally independent nation.
5.  **Embargoes and Sanctions:**
    *   Diplomatic actions to restrict trade:
        *   **Embargo:** A ban on trade of specific goods (e.g., weapons embargo) or all trade with a target nation.
            *   Can be unilateral or multilateral (more effective).
            *   Aims: Weaken a rival's economy, pressure them politically, signal disapproval.
        *   **Sanctions:** Broader economic penalties.
            *   Freezing assets of the target nation or its citizens held abroad.
            *   Restricting access to international financial markets.
            *   Travel bans for key individuals.
    *   Effectiveness depends on the target's reliance on external trade and the breadth of international participation in the sanctions.
    *   Can backfire, harming the imposing nation's own economy or leading to the target seeking alternative partners.
    *   May be used as a prelude to or an alternative to war.

## III. Industrialization & Production Deepening

1.  **Resource Discovery & Depletion:**
    *   **Discovery:**
        *   Certain resources (e.g., coal, iron) might be known at game start, while others (e.g., oil, rubber, uranium) require specific technologies or survey actions to discover.
        *   Prospecting/exploration missions can be sent to provinces. Success chance based on tech, terrain, and perhaps geologist leaders.
        *   Events can trigger discoveries (e.g., "Gold found in province X!").
    *   **Depletion:**
        *   Resource deposits have a finite quantity.
        *   Rate of depletion depends on extraction intensity (number and tech level of mines/RGOs).
        *   As a resource depletes, extraction might become more costly or less efficient.
        *   Forces nations to secure new sources through trade, diplomacy, or conquest, or to develop alternative technologies/resources.
        *   "Peak oil" (or peak coal/iron) scenarios can create economic challenges.
2.  **Technological Impact on Production:**
    *   Researchable technologies directly affect industry:
        *   **New Factory Types:** Unlocking production of new goods (e.g., automobiles, radios, synthetic materials).
        *   **Improved Efficiency:**
            *   Increased output per worker or per unit of input (e.g., assembly line).
            *   Reduced input goods needed for the same output.
            *   Faster production cycles.
        *   **New Resource Requirements:** Some advanced goods might require newly discovered or processed resources.
        *   **Production Method Changes:** E.g., Bessemer process for cheaper steel, shift from charcoal to coke in iron smelting.
        *   **Automation:** Reducing labor needs for certain industries, potentially causing unemployment but increasing productivity.
    *   Technology spread: Can be slow, depending on literacy, relations with advanced nations, espionage.
3.  **Infrastructure Development (Strategic/Economic Layer):**
    *   More detailed infrastructure projects beyond simple "levels":
        *   **Railways:**
            *   Player directly plans and funds railway lines connecting specific provinces/cities.
            *   Different gauges or tech levels of rail.
            *   Boosts supply throughput for armies, trade capacity between connected points, pop migration speed, and factory efficiency in connected regions (easier access to resources/markets).
        *   **Ports:**
            *   Upgrading specific city ports to handle more/larger ships.
            *   Drydocks for naval construction/repair.
            *   Impacts overseas trade capacity, naval range/supply.
        *   **Canals:**
            *   Major strategic projects like Suez, Panama, Kiel canals (if historically appropriate or conditions met).
            *   Significantly alter global trade routes and naval deployments. Require massive investment and time.
        *   **Roads/Telegraphs:** Earlier forms of infrastructure improving local commerce and communication.
    *   Requires significant state or private investment, raw materials (e.g., steel for rails), and time.
    *   Can be targeted in warfare.
4.  **Specialized Capital Goods:**
    *   Differentiate more clearly between:
        *   **Consumer Goods:** Tools, clothing, furniture for pop consumption.
        *   **Capital Goods (Machinery/Equipment):** Specialized items required by factories to produce other goods.
            *   E.g., textile mills need looms, steel mills need furnaces, chemical plants need specialized vats/reactors.
            *   These are not directly consumed by pops but are essential for industrial output.
    *   Production of capital goods can become a strategic industry itself (machine tool industry).
    *   Nations might need to import capital goods if they lack the domestic industry, or prioritize developing it.
    *   Technological advances can lead to new, more efficient capital goods.
5.  **Supply Chains & Vertical Integration:**
    *   More emphasis on the flow of goods through various stages of production.
        *   E.g., Iron Ore (mine) -> Steel (mill) -> Machine Parts (factory) -> Automobiles (factory).
    *   **Vertical Integration:** Corporations or the state controlling multiple stages of a supply chain.
        *   Benefits: Reduced transaction costs, more reliable supply, potentially greater profits.
        *   Can be encouraged through policy or emerge naturally through market forces.
        *   May lead to powerful monopolies or trusts.
    *   Bottlenecks in a supply chain (e.g., shortage of coal for steel mills) can have cascading effects on downstream industries.
    *   Player needs to consider the entire chain when planning industrial development.

## IV. Population & Labor

1.  **Pop Needs Evolution:**
    *   Pop needs are not static; they change based on:
        *   **Wealth:** As pops get richer, they demand more and better quality goods.
            *   Basic needs (grain, basic clothes) are supplemented or replaced by processed food (bread, canned goods), luxury food (wine, coffee), better clothes, furniture.
            *   Eventually, demand for new consumer goods (bicycles, radios, cars if available).
        *   **Technology/Literacy:** Increased literacy may lead to demand for books, newspapers. New inventions create new desires.
        *   **Social Class:** Aristocrats might have higher base demand for luxury goods than farmers.
    *   Unmet needs (especially for essentials) lead to low happiness, starvation, emigration, and political radicalism.
    *   Meeting higher-tier needs contributes to happiness and potentially social advancement.
2.  **Education & Literacy:**
    *   **Education System:**
        *   Player can invest in education through national spending, building schools.
        *   Different levels: elementary, secondary, higher education (universities).
    *   **Literacy Rate:** Percentage of pops able to read and write.
        *   Increases with education spending and certain social reforms.
        *   Impacts:
            *   **Research Speed:** Higher literacy = faster technological progress.
            *   **Job Qualification:** Certain jobs (clerks, officers, engineers, scientists, bureaucrats) require minimum literacy/education levels.
            *   **Political Awareness/Consciousness:** Literate pops are more likely to adopt ideologies, join political movements, and have higher political demands.
            *   **Efficiency of some professions:** E.g., more effective bureaucrats.
    *   Universities can produce "research points" or specific types of skilled professionals.
3.  **Labor Unions & Working Conditions:**
    *   **Emergence of Labor Movements:**
        *   Driven by poor working conditions, low wages, long hours, especially in industrializing societies.
        *   Pops (especially craftsmen, laborers in factories) can form unions.
        *   Union strength influenced by pop militancy, political reforms, and certain technologies/ideologies (e.g., socialism).
    *   **Union Demands:**
        *   Higher wages.
        *   Shorter working hours (e.g., 8-hour day).
        *   Improved factory safety regulations.
        *   Right to organize, collective bargaining.
    *   **Player Responses & Consequences:**
        *   **Negotiate/Implement Reforms:** (e.g., factory safety laws, minimum wage, maximum working hours).
            *   Can improve pop happiness, reduce militancy, potentially increase productivity in the long run.
            *   May increase costs for factories, potentially making them less competitive.
        *   **Suppress Unions:** Use police/military to break strikes, ban unions.
            *   Can maintain short-term industrial output and profits.
            *   Leads to increased pop militancy, radicalism, potential for revolts.
        *   **Ignore Demands:** Risk of strikes, lower factory output, increased unrest.
    *   Strikes: Organized work stoppages by unions, halting production in affected factories/industries.

## V. Other Potential Areas

*   **Espionage (Economic Focus):**
    *   **Industrial Espionage:** Steal industrial technologies from more advanced nations.
        *   Chance of success based on spy skill, target nation's counter-espionage, relations.
        *   Getting caught can lead to diplomatic incidents.
    *   **Sabotage Industries:** Damage rival nations' key factories or infrastructure.
    *   **Counter-Espionage:** Protect domestic industries and technologies.
    *   Recruit spies, fund intelligence agency.
*   **Events & Crises (Economic Focus):**
    *   **Dynamic Historical Events:** (e.g., Panic of 1873, Long Depression).
    *   **Plausible Ahistorical Events:**
        *   Stock market booms and crashes.
        *   Discovery of major new resource deposits or sudden depletion of old ones.
        *   Natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, famines) impacting specific regions/industries.
        *   Banking crises, runs on banks.
        *   Invention breakthroughs outside of standard tech tree.
    *   These events should have significant, often immediate, economic impacts (price changes, unemployment, factory closures, shifts in investment).
    *   Player may have choices in how to respond to crises.
*   **Logistics & Supply (Military & Civilian):**
    *   **Military Logistics:**
        *   Armies require food, ammunition, equipment. Supply lines are crucial.
        *   Attrition from lack of supply.
        *   Infrastructure (rail, ports) key for supplying large armies, especially in enemy territory.
    *   **Civilian Supply:**
        *   Ensuring pops have access to essential goods, especially food.
        *   Internal trade and infrastructure critical for distributing goods within the nation.
        *   Shortages can lead to starvation, unrest.
*   **Political Economy:**
    *   Deeper connections between economic conditions and political landscape:
        *   **Pop Ideologies:** Economic hardship might push pops towards radical ideologies (socialism, fascism, communism). Prosperity might lead to more liberal or conservative views.
        *   **Interest Group Power:** Wealthy industrialists, landowners, or financiers might form powerful lobbies influencing government policy.
        *   **Government Types:** Certain economic policies might be easier or harder to enact under different government types (e.g., democracies more responsive to pop demands, autocracies more able to impose unpopular but necessary reforms).
        *   Economic grievances as a primary driver for rebellions and revolutions.
*   **War Reparations & Economic Warfare:**
    *   **Peace Treaties:** Include economic clauses beyond territorial changes:
        *   **War Reparations:** Loser pays a sum of money or goods to the victor over time. Can cripple the loser's economy or boost the victor's.
        *   **Seizure of Economic Assets:** Transfer of factories, mines, or colonial holdings.
        *   **Forced Trade Concessions:** Forcing a nation to lower tariffs or grant preferential market access.
    *   **Economic Warfare during Conflict:**
        *   Targeting enemy industry, infrastructure, and trade (strategic bombing, blockades).
        *   Debasing enemy currency.
        *   Preclusive buying: Buying up strategic resources on the global market to deny them to the enemy.
*   **Corporation Mechanics Deepening:**
    *   Corporations having more distinct AI behaviors based on specialization, owner personality (if modeled), or market conditions.
    *   Mergers and acquisitions between corporations.
    *   State-owned enterprises vs. private corporations with different goals and efficiencies.
    *   Bankruptcy mechanics for corporations.
*   **Resource Scarcity and Substitution:**
    *   As key resources become scarce or expensive, technologies or policies could allow for substitution.
        *   E.g., synthetic rubber if natural rubber is unavailable.
        *   Different fuel types for factories or navies (coal -> oil).
    *   This adds dynamism and requires long-term strategic resource planning.
*   **Environmental Effects (Optional/Advanced):**
    *   Industrial pollution affecting pop health or agricultural output in provinces.
    *   Resource extraction (deforestation, overfishing) having long-term negative consequences.
    *   Could tie into pop happiness, political movements (early environmentalism), or even global climate effects if modeled very long-term.
