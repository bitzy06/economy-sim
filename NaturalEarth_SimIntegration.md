# Using Natural Earth for Simulation Structure

## Why Natural Earth?

Natural Earth provides free, small-sized, and high-quality GIS datasets that are perfect for game development, especially for simulating global or regional economies, geography, and politics — **without the overhead of full OpenStreetMap data**.

---

## Recommended Dataset: States/Provinces

**File**: `ne_10m_admin_1_states_provinces.shp`  
Also available at 50m and 110m resolution for lower detail

### ✅ Includes:
- Polygons for all first-level administrative units (states, provinces, etc.)
- Metadata:
  - `name`
  - `country`
  - `type` (state, region, etc.)
  - `ISO/ADM codes`
  - `population` (approximate)

---

## How to Use It in Your Game

### 1. Game Region Partitioning
- Treat each province as a simulation region or “SimCluster”
- Apply region-based rules (taxes, policies, weather, etc.)

### 2. Economic Scaling
- Assign economic output or resource generation to each province
- Use population or area as weights for scaling

### 3. Event & Narrative Hooks
- Target events to specific regions (e.g. "Flood in Punjab")
- Color overlays, regional challenges, etc.

### 4. UI and Map Labels
- Use polygon centers for labels ("Texas", "Bavaria")
- Draw outlines on zoomed-out map layers

---

## Integration Workflow

1. Load `.shp` file with GIS tool (e.g., GDAL, NetTopologySuite)
2. Project to your world grid
3. Store bounding boxes, simplified outlines, and metadata
4. Use for:
   - Regional logic
   - Province-level overlays
   - Organizing towns/cities

---

## Bonus: Combining with OSM (Optional)

If you later want towns or roads:

- Use filtered `.pbf` files from [Geofabrik.de](https://download.geofabrik.de/)
- Assign each town to a province via polygon test
- Avoid loading the full OSM dataset — just grab what you need, region by region

## Why Avoid Full OSM?

| Problem | OSM Planet File |
|--------|-----------------|
| Size | 82 GB |
| Complexity | XML or PBF parsing, data filtering |
| Processing | Requires external tools (`osmium`, `osmconvert`) |
| Solution | Use Natural Earth + Optional filtered regional OSM |

---

## Summary

Use **Natural Earth** as your simulation backbone:

| Layer | Source        | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| World | Natural Earth | Countries, oceans |
| Region | Natural Earth | States/provinces for economic & political logic |
| Local | (Optional) OSM | Towns, roads where needed |
| Street | Procedural | Fine-grained game content |

This gives you control, performance, and scalability — without the hassle of massive OSM processing.
